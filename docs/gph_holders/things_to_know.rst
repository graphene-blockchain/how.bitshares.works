For the Starter
========================

* **Security and Control over accounts and funds**:
  No one can access your funds unless you let them, intentionally, or unintentionally. With the power to be independent from 3rd parties, comes the responsibility to protect what belongs to you.

* **Can interact with people directly**:
  With Graphene it becomes possible to interact with people directly without needing to go through a middleman.  Hence, Graphene is a platform of free speech that implements a payment platform and exchange for digital goods.

* **Fast**:
  Transactions in Graphene are verified and irrevocable in only a few seconds   time.

* **Decentralized Committee**:
  Decisions that can effect the Graphene ecosystem are made using a on-chain committee voted upon by shareholders.  Hence, no single entity can change the deal retroactively.

* **Flexible**:
  Protocol upgrades (formerly known as *hard forks*) can be implemented and executed to improve the Graphene business over time and allow to react on.

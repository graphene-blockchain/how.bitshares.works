Welcome to the Graphene Documentation
========================================
Much of that technology is embodied in Grapheneâ„¢, an industrial strength software platform for deploying third generation cryptographically secure decentralized ledgers known as block chains.

Graphene based systems have orders of magnitude better performance than first-generation Bitcoin-derived systems or even the second generation "Bitcoin 2.0" systems that constitute our current closest competitors. Graphene based systems go beyond mere "checkbook" style payments to offer a broad range of financial services distinguished by their transparency and inherent incorruptibility.

This page documents the `Graphene`_ technology. You can see Graphene as a toolkit for real-time blockchains. We separated the documentation into smaller parts for convenience and for the sake of easy location of relevant information.


Blockchain Specific Guides
--------------------------------

The Graphene Technology has been applied to several blockchain already. You will be able to find almost everything feature implemented in Graphene. Further blockchains will be added independently.

`Graphene`_ is a Financial Smart Contracts platform that enables trading of digital assets and has market-pegged assets that track the value of their underlying asset (e.g. gpUSD tracking the U.S. dollar).

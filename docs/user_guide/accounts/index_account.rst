Graphene Accounts
********************

In Graphene, you can create an account relatively easily by using the Graphene UI wallet.  The account comes with the Private/public keys. You should keep the information safe. Also, Graphene account gives you some benefits (i.e., Lifetime Membership (LTM) and Referral Program) and important roles (i.e., voting).  We recommend you to read through Graphene Accounts information to learn more.
